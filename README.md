Building Microservices with Spring Boot, Maven, Docker, and Kubernetes

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy microservices using Spring Boot for backend development, Maven for dependency management, Docker for containerization, and Kubernetes for orchestration. The microservices are designed to be scalable, resilient, and cloud-native.

Tech Stack:
Spring Boot – Develop RESTful microservices
Maven – Build and manage dependencies
Docker – Containerize the microservices
Kubernetes – Deploy and orchestrate services
